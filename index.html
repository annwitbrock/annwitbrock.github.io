   <h2>Hello World, <\h2>
   <p>sorry to disappoint, this needs some serious attention soon. Like proper html.<\p>
<\div>
   
<div>
   <p>It just isn't as distracting as everything else, like learning languages on duolingo, 
or how solar cells are made on coursera, or robots. <\p>
<p>But rest assured, recent activity has also involved learning to use flask and vagrant, and sqlalchemy,
and also improving that pesky javascript (which I had been putting off),
along with a lot of stuff on web performance, and a bit of down to earth Networking revision (more to do).<\p>
<\div>
   
<div>
   <p>All that between playing piano, gardening, painting, baking and earning a crust, 
and finding amazing things round the clock via round the globe friends on social media.
It turns out I can even dance still. Well no longer polished pro, but at least standing upright.<\p>

   <p>Enough about me. Over to you - find me on twitter.<\p>
